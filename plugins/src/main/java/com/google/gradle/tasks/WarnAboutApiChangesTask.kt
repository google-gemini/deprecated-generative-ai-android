/**
 * A Gradle task to warn about API changes made during development.
 *
 * By default, saved in the root project's build directory under `api_changes.md`. The task uses the
 * provided [changesFile] to infer if merging the changes currently present in the repo will have an
 * impact on the public api.
 *
 * This should help developers avoid accidentally leaking internal implementation details into the
 * public API, and causing breaking changes without noticing.
 *
 * The generated message is intended to be safe to display straight to the developer.
 *
 * If no public api changes are found, then no message will be generated and the task will skip
 * itself.
 *
 * @property changesFile a file contained a [LinesChanged]; representing the changes made in this
 *   repo
 * @property outputFile where to save the warning message to
 * @throws SkipTask if no public api changes are found
